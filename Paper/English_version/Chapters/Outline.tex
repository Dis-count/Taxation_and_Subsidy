\section{Outline}

For the effective domain $[0, P^*]$, we just need to divide this interval into several parts and the points are denoted as $P_L(V,i), i = 1,2,\ldots,n$.  At first, we don't need to calculate the initial part because this part the corresponding subsidy is 0 always. Then we just need to focus on the latter part which shows some interesting properties we proved above.

For any P in $[0, P^*]$, calculate the subsidy and the corresponding slope (Please refer to Liu et.al.2018) z
