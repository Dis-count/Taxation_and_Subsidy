It is useful for the weighted

Repeat the process and point out the difference.

As we've already known that $P_L(V,i), i = 1,2,\ldots,n$ can be obtained by Lemma \ref{lem1} and Theorem \ref{thm2}, we just need to follow the CP approach (Algorithm 3 in Liu et.al.2018) to calculate the weak derivatives at each sub-interval $[P_L(m,V),P_H(m,V)]$ where the corresponding derivative is $m_V-\sum_{s\in S\setminus\{V\}} \rho_s$.

Then use IPC Algorithm which will return all the breakpoints during the $[0, P^*]$ to obtain the subsidy $\omega(P)$.

Notice that we can calculate the characteristic function $c(s)$ easily according to Theorem \ref{thm5}, we can formulate Theorem \ref{thm6}.
